# Why Use "Chat" (a.k.a. Threads) for Your AI Experiences?

Modern AI doesn't stop at one-turn completions. If you're building with conversational AI, **threaded chat** (a.k.a. "Chat") is the structure behind truly intelligent, useful, and persistent assistants. Think of it like ChatGPT's conversations—stored, contextual, and evolving.

# What Is a Chat Thread?

A **thread** is a persistent conversation—made up of messages between a user and an assistant. It's not just about history; it’s about memory, intent, context, and relationship.

<Info />

# Why Threads Are a Game-Changer

### Built-In Context History

Threads preserve the full message history by default.

* No need to re-send long prompts each time
* Context-aware responses feel **more helpful and consistent**
* Supports **multi-turn reasoning** and corrections (e.g., “Actually, I meant…”) You get session persistence without writing session logic.

### First-Class RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Threads pair naturally with **RAG systems** by grounding responses on:

* **Domain-specific docs**
* **Internal knowledge bases**
* **External APIs or tools** Chat threads can be augmented with **value-aligned sources** that ensure responses stay on-brand, accurate, and compliant.

## Immediate Access to Proprietary Features

Using the "Chat" object lets you leverage powerful, production-ready features like:

| Feature          | What It Does                                                                           |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File Attachments | Automatically ingest and summarize user files                                          |
| Metadata         | Tag threads with business logic, user info, or app state                               |
| Tool Calling     | Threads integrate seamlessly with structured function calls                            |
| Model Routing    | Dynamically upgrade or fallback to different mode                                      |
| Thread Memory    | Fine-tuned recall of prior interactions (coming soon or available in enterprise tiers) |

These features are **ready to use without building your own conversation manager.**

## Aligns with Real User Mental Models

People don’t talk to AI one prompt at a time. They:

* Ask follow-ups
* Refer back to previous context
* Expect the AI to “remember” Threads let your app feel **human, collaborative, and intelligent**—not transactional.

## Foundation for Personalization and Long-Term Memory

With chat threads, you're creating a **structured, queryable history** that can:

* Be used to personalize future sessions
* Train fine-tuned models
* Build product analytics around AI interactions It’s more than chat—it's **conversational infrastructure.**

# TL;DR: Why Use Chat Threads?

| Benefit               | Description                              |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Persistent Context    | Memory-like multi-turn interaction       |
| RAG-Friendly          | Built to plug in high-quality knowledge  |
| Feature-Rich          | Attach files, call tools, store metadata |
| Personalization-Ready | Enables adaptive, long-term assistants   |
| Infra-Free            | No need to manage context state yourself |

**Start building** with Chat threads today and skip the infrastructure headaches.

Whether you're building support bots, copilots, or AI apps, **threads are the conversational primitive you’ll never want to give up.**
