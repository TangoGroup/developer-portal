## Upload Your Content

Before you can upload and enrich your data, you must be at least [one publisher created in your organization](https://docs.ai.gloo.com/docs/creatingmanaging-publishers#/). This publisher can also be referred to as a tenant in Data Engine.

After you have a publisher in your organization, go to Data Engine and upload your content.
