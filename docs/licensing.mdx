# Licensing & Data Exchange

**Licensing** is the trusted data exchange layer at Gloo AI. It secures and manages the flow of information between content creators and consumers, ensuring that all data sharing is governed by clear permissions and ethical standards.

## Key Concepts

* **Secure Data Exchange:** Implements a zero-trust architecture to ensure that data sharing happens securely and with full auditability.
* **Permissioned Access:** Enforces rights-aware access controls so that only authorized users can access sensitive data.
* **Licensing Models:** Supports flexible licensing agreements that tie data usage to organizational policies and subscription models.
* **Integration with Studio:** Licensing controls are embedded directly in Studio, enabling real-time data sharing and content monetization.

## For Developers

* **API Access:** Licensing information is exposed via APIs so that developers can build applications that integrate secure data sharing and usage tracking.
* **Extensibility:** The licensing framework is designed to support evolving use casesâ€”from one-off data exchanges to long-term content licensing and marketplace features.
* **Transparency:** All licensing actions are logged and can be audited, ensuring compliance with industry standards and trust requirements.
