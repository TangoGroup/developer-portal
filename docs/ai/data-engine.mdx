## What It Does

* **Data Ingestion:** Supports bulk APIs, RSS feeds, scraped content, and structured formats to bring diverse ministry data into the platform.
* **Enrichment & Tagging:** Uses advanced NLP to automatically tag and categorize data, making it searchable and contextually rich.
* **Ontology & Taxonomy Management:** Reveals inferred relationships between data points and maps them to publisher metadata for a deeper contextual understanding.
* **Search & Discovery:** Enables high-fidelity search tuned for ministry-specific queries with transparent relevance scoring.
* **RAG Infrastructure:** Supports retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines that link AI outputs to source documents and rationales.

## How It Benefits Developers

* **Contextual Intelligence:** Provides a rich layer of metadata and ontology mapping so applications can surface insights that are ministry-ready.
* **Extensibility:** Designed to be integrated into custom workflows—whether you’re building search tools, dashboards, or content licensing systems.
* **Transparency:** Every data transformation and enrichment step is auditable, ensuring that developers can trace how insights are generated.
