# 🔐 Understanding Orgs & Publishers in Gloo Studio

Gloo Studio is built to enable secure, scalable, and collaborative AI workflows across organizations and publishers. At the core of this architecture is our multi-tenant [data engine](https://docs.ai.gloo.com/docs/data-engine#/), which ensures data isolation and control while empowering teams to create, manage, and deploy AI assets confidently.

To support this, Studio uses a robust permission and ownership model built around two primary entities: Organizations and Publishers.

## 🏢 Organizations: The Source of Truth for Ownership

An Org (short for “Organization”) represents the root entity in Gloo Studio’s multi-tenant architecture. All data, models, projects, and assets are scoped to a specific Org, ensuring:

• Data Isolation: Data stored under an Org is completely isolated from all other Orgs in both storage and compute. • Access Control: Only users explicitly added to the Org can access or act on its resources, based on their roles. • Audibility: All actions taken on Org-owned assets are logged and attributable to specific users, supporting regulatory and internal audit requirements.

Org-level capabilities include:

• API key management • Embedding and retrieval pipelines • Publisher management

## 🧾 Publishers: Creating and Curating on Behalf of an Org

A Publisher is a specific persona or sub-entity within an Org that produces and maintains AI assets (e.g., models, datasets, assistants, templates, content). Publishers allow Gloo Studio to support a separation of identity from ownership, while preserving control.

Think of a Publisher as: • A brand, team, or public-facing identity within an Org • The owner of record for any assets published to shared environments. • A scoped permission boundary for who can act as that Publisher

Key features: • Assets are created by a Publisher • Publishers can only act within their parent Org • Access to create/edit as a Publisher is role-gated and auditable

# 🛡️ Security by Design

Behind the scenes, Gloo enforces a strict multi-tenant security model: • Logical and physical isolation at the storage layer (S3, DB, vector store) • Org ID propagation in every API and job submission request • Publisher-scoped permissions enforce principle of least privilege • Zero-leakage guarantee: No customer or IP data is ever exposed to another Org • Gloo Studio Audit Layer: Full traceability of actions, changes, and data movement across Orgs and Publishers

# 📌 Why This Matters

By making Orgs the secure boundary and Publishers the creative surface, Gloo Studio enables: • Enterprise-grade data governance • Safe team collaboration at scale • Clear attribution and control of public assets • Extensibility across internal teams, external partners, and public consumption
