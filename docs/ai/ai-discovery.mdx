## Customize your widget:

The Widget Builder four steps with a fifth to embed it on your site.

1. Theme Setup:
   * Customize your widget's button — adjust its color, shape, position, and overall style.

2. Metadata:

   * Select the Publisher through which you want to search content.
   * If you don't have an existing publisher, a prompt will guide you to create one via /organizations.

3. Layout Setup:

   * Configure the layout of search results (choose between horizontal cards or vertical cards).
   * Set placeholder text for the search input fields.

4. Configuration (Config Step):

   * Enter your API credentials and define allowed domains where the widget can be embedded.
   * If no API key exists, you'll be redirected to /build/keys to create one.

Ensure you save your configuration in this step — it will then appear in your configurations list (top right).

**Note:** There is a tutorial to help you with guide you through these steps.

## Embedding your widget

When you save a new configuration, the Widget Builder will automatically bring you to the fifth step, where it will generate an embed code.
