## One Login, Full Access

Gloo AI includes:

* **Gloo AI Chat** – chat with your data
* **Gloo AI Studio** – manage APIs and credentials

Creating an account on **either one** gives you access to **both** — no separate signups needed.

## Authentication Methods

Gloo AI Studio uses secure authentication and offers multiple ways to sign in:

* Google Single Sign-On (SSO) (preferred method)
* Standard email/password login

To make things fast and easy, we recommend signing in with **Google**.

If you are creating a Gloo AI account using a Google account (preferred), you can click on "Sign In with Google" and it will automatically create Gloo AI account.

**Note:** *If you create an account with Google's Single Sign-On, you will need to continually sign in with Google's Single Sign-On, as Gloo AI does not have access to your Google password.*

Once this is completed, you will then be redirected to the screen below prior to entering Gloo AI Studio. If you have any pending invites to an organization you will see them here and can get redirected to accept it. Otherwise you can click the 'Enter Studio' button as a developer and generate API credentials for accessing our endpoints:
