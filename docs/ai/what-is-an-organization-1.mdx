title: "What is An Organization?"
description: "Our structure for organizing content creators allows for flexibility and scalability, so Gloo AI Studio's tools can be used by individual content creators to large book publishers."

In Gloo AI Studio, all content creators are part of an organization. An organization is the top level of this hierarchy with publishers contained within the organization. All content also belongs to a publisher. The diagram below shows an example of how this works.

Smaller organizations who do not have internal divisions, like a podcast host are represented in the diagram by Organization 1. When a new Organization is onboarded for someone like a podcast host, it serves as both the Organization and Publisher at the same time.

Larger organizations are represented by Organization 2, where the overarching organization has rights to all of its subsidiary data. In this case, the singular book publisher works as an organization, and the individual authors are publishers underneath that organization. When the admin of the overarching Organization wants to update licensing for individual authors, they are able to do so.
