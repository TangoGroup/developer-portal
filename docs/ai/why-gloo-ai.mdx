# Core Values Makes Us Different to the Core

While other AI companies strive to advance AI technology for profit or for the sake of advancement, Gloo AI is different. We are centered on human flourishing, and our differentiators stem from that belief in redemptive AI.

## 📂 Open Source Model Advantage

While other companies create proprietary platforms to protect their IP, we encourage collaboration and allow the AI community to build together. We want to advance values-based AI through [open-source](https://docs.ai.gloo.com/docs/open#/) research, models, learnings, data, and standards.

## 🔒 Secure Data Controls and Guardrails

We want to protect our users and our publishers with their personal information and content. While other companies may sell your data or use content without permission, we strive to give credit where credit is due and protect that credit.

## 🤝 Values and Human Flourishing at the Core

We are dedicated to developing and deploying AI solutions that embody the highest ethical standards. We have developed Flourishing AI Standards making sure our solutions are tools for the common good.

## 🪟 Transparent but Scalable and Secure Infrastructure

We will build trust with our products, ensuring strong performance without sacrificing security.

## 💡 Solution Centric

At Gloo AI, we want to help others with their needs, focusing on solutions rather than hype.
