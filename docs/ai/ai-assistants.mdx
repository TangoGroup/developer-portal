# Building Guardrailed Assistants

**Gloo AI Assistants** are role-specific, retrieval-augmented chatbots that serve as intelligent, context-aware copilots for ministry and nonprofit environments. Initially built on public or partner-approved datasets, our assistants are designed for trust and real-world utility.

## Core Features

* **RAG-Based Responses:** Leverages retrieval-augmented generation to provide answers that are traceable to underlying data and source documents.
* **Domain-Specific Customization:** Each assistant is tailored for specific ministry roles, ensuring that responses are contextually relevant.
* **Guardrails for Trust:** Built with robust safety and provenance layers to ensure outputs are transparent, explainable, and aligned with ethical guidelines.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Our roadmap includes migration to Gloo-hosted internal model infrastructure (e.g., Llama 3.3) for improved performance and customization.

## Developer Benefits

* **Integrated Management:** Assistants can be managed directly through the Studio interface, enabling prompt versioning, configuration, and monitoring.
* **Custom Workflows:** Easily integrate assistants into custom applications or workflows with clear APIs and comprehensive documentation.
* **Feedback Loops:** Built-in mechanisms allow end-users to provide structured feedback that continuously improves assistant performance.
