# Why Use Standard Chat Completions?

Standard chat completions—like OpenAI’s `chat/completions` endpoint—are quickly becoming the *industry default* for building conversational AI. Whether you're developing a chatbot, virtual assistant, or AI-powered automation, here's why sticking with the standard just makes sense.

<Info />

# Familiar Developer Experience

If you've used tools like OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM providers, you've likely already encountered the `chat` format: a sequence of messages between `system`, `user`, and `assistant`.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash bash
  [
    { "role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant." },
    { "role": "user", "content": "How do I reset my password?" }
  ]
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This simple message-based interface has become the **standard across APIs**—making it easier to build, test, and scale without needing to relearn a custom format for every provider.

# Plug-and-Play with Tools and SDKs

Standard chat completions are supported out-of-the-box by:

* Popular SDKs (`openai`, `langchain`, `llamaindex`, etc.)
* Prompt engineering tools
* Debugging/observability dashboards
* Prompt versioning platforms
* Orchestration frameworks

That means **less boilerplate** and **more productivity**.

# Easily Portable Across Models

Using a standard chat format lets you switch between:

* OpenAI's GPT models
* Anthropic's Claude
* Google Gemini
* Open-source chat models like Mistral, LLaMA, or Mixtral

...without rewriting your app logic.

Standardization lets you **benchmark models**, compare outputs, and even build model-agnostic fallbacks or ensembles.

# Better Alignment with Human Intent

The chat format encourages natural interaction flow, including:

* Clarification (multi-turn)
* Function/tool calling
* Role-based prompting (e.g. system as context setter)

It also makes features like **memory**, **tool use**, and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** feel native, rather than bolted on.

# Built-In Support for Advanced Features

Using chat completions gives you access to:

* Function/tool calling
* JSON mode
* Temperature/top\_p control
* Streaming support
* Multi-turn context windows

These features are essential for **reliable**, **context-aware**, and **real-time** applications.

# Supported by the Ecosystem

From hosting providers to vector databases, the whole AI tooling ecosystem now expects the standard chat format. It’s the easiest way to stay compatible and future-proof your codebase.
