## Create Your Organization

You will need to be in an [organization](https://docs.ai.gloo.com/docs/organizations#/) to upload your content and use the suite of tools in Gloo AI Studio.

After [creating a user profile](https://docs.ai.gloo.com/docs/signing-up#/), sign in to Gloo AI Studio. If you did not receive an email inviting you to join an existing organization, you can create one in Gloo AI Studio:

1. Click on your user name at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. Click on 'Mange Organizations'
3. Click the black 'Create New Organization' button and complete the required fields.

## Upload Your Content

Before you can upload and enrich your data, you must have at least [one publisher created in your organization](https://docs.ai.gloo.com/docs/creatingmanaging-publishers#/).

After you have a publisher in your organization, go to Data Engine and upload your content.
