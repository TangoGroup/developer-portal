title: 'Real Time Ingestion'
description: 'Guide to uploading text for instant processing and vectorization'
---

The Real-Time Ingestion API allows developers to upload text content directly for immediate processing and vectorization. Unlike batch upload methods, this API processes content in real-time, making it suitable for dynamic content that needs to be immediately available for search or retrieval.

## API Endpoint

To ingest content, make a POST request to the following endpoint:

```
POST /ingestion/v1/real_time_upload
```

```
Base URL: https://platform.ai.gloo.com
```

---

## Authentication

The API requires a JWT token with specific claims to authorize access. The token must be associated with a Client ID that has access to the specified publisher. The system validates that the organization associated with your Client ID has permission to access the publisher specified in your request.

### Headers

| Header          | Value                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer <your_access_token>`         |
| `Content-Type`  | `application/json`                   |

### JWT Token Requirements

Your JWT must include the following claims:
-   A `sub` claim containing your API Client ID.
-   A `scope` claim that includes `api/access`.

<Info>
You will only be able to send content to a publisher that belongs to your organization. Please double-check the `publisher_id` field in the request body for accuracy.
</Info>
