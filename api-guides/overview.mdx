## Content & Data APIs

These APIs are designed for content owners, publishers, and data administrators. Use them to populate the Gloo AI platform with your unique data and make it available for semantic search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Real Time Ingestion API" href="/api-guides/ingestion" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Upload text content directly for immediate processing and vectorization. Ideal for dynamic content.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Search API" href="/api-guides/search" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Query your ingested content using our AI-based, near-text, semantic search capabilities.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Conversational AI APIs

These APIs are for developers building interactive AI experiences. They provide access to our powerful language models and the foundational structures needed for creating sophisticated, multi-turn conversations.

<CardGroup>
  <Card title="Completions API" href="/api-guides/completions" icon="sparkles">
    The standard, foundational endpoint for interacting with our LLMs using a familiar message-based format.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tools for Completions" href="/api-guides/tools-use" icon="wrench">
    Extend model capabilities by allowing them to call external functions and interact with other systems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Chat (Threads)" href="/api-guides/chat" icon="messages">
    Build stateful, multi-turn conversations with built-in memory, context, and history.
  </Card>
