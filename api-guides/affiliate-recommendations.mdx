## Overview

Similar to Search, the Affiliate Recommendations endpoint provides intelligent content discovery by searching through a comprehensive database of licensed, published materials to find items that are semantically related to a user's query. Specifically, it returns items based on the number of **snippets** found that are associated with that item.

- **Snippets**: A snippet is a section of a content item (like a podcast episode, article, or book) that represents a meaningful piece of information our AI tools can search and understand. They are the recorded units of searchable content in our backend systems.

- **Ranking Logic**: Items are ranked first by the number of relevant snippets found. If two or more items have the same snippet count, they are then ranked by their **cumulative certainty**.

- **Certainty Score**: This is a confidence metric indicating how well a snippet matches the user's query. Higher scores mean stronger relevance. Cumulative certainty is the sum of these individual scores, providing an overall confidence measure for the item's relevance.

To protect intellectual property, the snippets themselves are not visible in the API response.

For example, for the query, "How do I raise kids as a new parent?", if a book has 10 relevant snippets, an article has 8, and a podcast has 6, the API ranks them in that order: book (10), article (8), podcast (6).

## Why use Affiliate Recommendations?

This API enables applications to surface contextually relevant content recommendations that enhance user engagement and discovery. It's perfect for providing "additional resources" or "recommended reading" based on a user's questions or interests. If a publisher filters on their own data, it also enables more exposure to their own content.
