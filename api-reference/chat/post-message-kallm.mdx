title: Post message Gloo Chat
description: 'Start or continue a chat session.'
---

By providing `chat_id` a new message will be added to the chat session. If no `chat_id` is provided, a new chat session will be created.

Default behavior:
* Gloo AI will perform a sentiment analysis on your prompt.
* Gloo AI will provide suggestion follow ups
* Depending on your prompt, Gloo AI will return sources that have influenced the response from our trusted partners.

You can choose to override the defaults with the query params: `intent`, `enable_sources`, `enable_suggestions`.

**Example 1**:
You want a rich answer that is based on trusted sources and provides you follow up suggestions. Omit all query params.

**Example 2**:
You know that your prompt is going to require trusted sources as a part of the answer. You also want to not have follow up suggestions.
`intent`: 1, `enable_suggestions`: 0

**Example 3**:
You know that your prompt is not going to require trusted sources. You also want to not have follow up suggestions.
`intent`: 0, `enable_suggestions`: 0
