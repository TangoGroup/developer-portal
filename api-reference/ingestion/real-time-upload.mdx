## Authentication

The API requires a JWT token with specific claims to authorize access. The token must be associated with a Client ID that has access to the specified publisher. The system validates that the organization associated with your Client ID has permission to access the publisher specified in your request.

### JWT Token Requirements

Your JWT must include the following claims:
-   A `sub` claim containing your API Client ID.
-   A `scope` claim that includes `api/access`.

<Info>
You will only be able to send content to a publisher that belongs to your organization. Please double-check the `publisher_id` field in the request body for accuracy.
