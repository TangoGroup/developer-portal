Welcome to the Gloo AI API! This reference documentation will help you build powerful applications by integrating directly with our platform's core capabilities, from conversational AI to content management.

Our API is built on standard REST principles, uses predictable resource-oriented URLs, and returns JSON-encoded responses.

---

## Authentication

All requests to the Gloo AI API must be authenticated. We use **Bearer Tokens** for authentication, which you can generate from a Client ID and Secret.

You must include your token in the `Authorization` header with every request.

```bash
curl "https://platform.ai.gloo.com/ai/v1/..." \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
````

<Info>
    Follow the [Authentication Tutorial](/tutorials/authentication) to learn how to exchange your Client credentials for an access token and manage token expiration.

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the following base URL:

```
https://platform.ai.gloo.com/ai/v1
```

-----

## Error Handling

The Gloo AI API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

  - Codes in the `2xx` range indicate success.
  - Codes in the `4xx` range indicate a client-side error (e.g., a missing parameter, bad authentication).
  - Codes in the `5xx` range indicate a server-side error on our end.

For a detailed list of all possible error codes and their meanings, please see our [**API Errors Guide**](/api-reference/general/errors).
