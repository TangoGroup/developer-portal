Gloo AI Studio provides a powerful workflow for managing your content through the **Data Engine**. This process transforms your raw data—be it documents, audio, or video—into ministry-ready insights that power search, discovery, and AI-driven features across the platform.

This guide covers the two-step process for content management in Studio:
1.  **Uploading Your Content:** The initial step of getting your files into the platform.
2.  **Enriching Your Content:** Adding the necessary metadata and tags to make your content discoverable and useful.

<Info>
**Prerequisite:** Before you can upload and enrich your data, you must have at least one **Publisher** created in your organization. The Publisher can also be referred to as a tenant in Data Engine. For more information, see the [Managing Your Organization](/studio/manage-organizations) guide.

## Step 1: Uploading Your Content

After you have a publisher in your organization, you can begin the upload process.

1.  Navigate to the **Data Engine** section from the main Studio sidebar.
2.  Click on **Upload Your Content**.
3.  Choose the upload method that best suits your needs. Studio offers several options:

    * **File Upload (Single/Multi/Zip):** For uploading individual files or a collection of files in a zip archive.
    * **Bulk Upload (Zip Files + Metadata):** For uploading a large number of files accompanied by a metadata manifest.
    * **Bulk Upload (Excel/CSV Containing Content):** For ingesting structured data directly from spreadsheets.
    * **Media Content:** For connecting and processing your audio and video files.

1.  From the **Data Engine** section, click on the **"Your Data"** tab.
2.  Select the file or files you wish to enrich and click the **"Continue Enrichment"** button.
3.  Complete the **Required Fields** form with as much detail as possible. This information will be crucial for tagging and organizing your data.

Key fields you will need to complete include:
-   **Publisher:** The publisher this content belongs to.
-   **Content Type:** The format of the content (e.g., Book, Podcast, Video, Article, Audio).
-   **Other Publisher Information:** Any additional metadata that will provide helpful context.
