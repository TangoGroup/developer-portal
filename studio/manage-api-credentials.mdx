Gloo AI Studio provides a secure and straightforward interface for generating the credentials required to interact with the Gloo AI API. This guide will walk you through creating credentials and generating temporary bearer tokens for testing and development.

## Generating API Credentials

Follow these steps to create a new set of API credentials (a Client ID and Client Secret).

1.  **Navigate to API Credentials:** From the main Studio sidebar, click on "API Credentials".

2.  **Choose Credential Type:** You have two options:
    * **Organization Credentials:** If you have the "Admin" role, you can create credentials that are tied to the entire organization.
    * **Personal Credentials:** If you do not have the Admin role, you can create credentials tied specifically to your user account.

3.  **Generate Client ID & Secret:** Click the "Create New Key" button. Enter a name for the key and click "Create".Studio will generate a new **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

    <Info>
    **Treat your Client Secret like a password!** It will only be shown once but you can always copy it to your clipboard later. Make sure to copy it and store it in a secure location.
    </Info>

4.  **Generate a Bearer Token:** Once you have a Client ID and Secret, click on the "Show API Instructions" button to view code examples you can use to generate a Bearer Token.
This token is what you will use in the `Authorization` header of your API calls.

## Important Note: Token Expiration

Access tokens (Bearer Tokens) generated from Studio are temporary and **expire after one hour**. This is a security feature to protect your account.

-   You can monitor the token's expiration by checking the `exp` (expiration time) claim in the JWT payload.
-   When a token expires, generate a new one programmatcally using your saved Client ID and Secret.
