# Authors & Individual Users

Gloo AI has a flexible user model that separates a person's account from their specific roles within different Publishers.

## Individual User
An **Individual User** is the most basic account type.

## Author
An **Author** is a user who creates content for one or more Publishers. An Individual User becomes an Author *only when they are invited by a Publisher and accept the invitation*.
