Welcome to the Gloo AI developer hub. This is where you can get started with Gloo AI using our step-by-step guides and reference documentation. You'll find everything you need to integrate, configure, and troubleshoot effectively.

## What Makes Gloo AI Unique?

Gloo AI exists to advance human flourishing by delivering values-aligned language models that provide clarity, empathy, and timely wisdom.

Unlike many AI efforts that focus primarily on technological advancement or commercial gain, Gloo AI starts from a different place. We're building with a focus on human flourishing, and that core principle shapes how we approach AI — what we build, how we build it, and why.
