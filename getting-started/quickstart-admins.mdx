Follow these steps to get up and running with Gloo AI Studio. This guide will walk you through creating an account, setting up your first organization, and inviting a team member.

### Step 1: Create Your Account

First, sign up for a Gloo AI account. You can do this by visiting the [Gloo AI Studio website](https://studio.ai.gloo.com/) and clicking on the "Sign Up" link.

### Step 2: Create Your First Organization

Click on your profile icon in the bottom right corner, select **Manage Organizations**, then click **Create Organization**.

An Organization is the top-level container for all your work. Give your organization a name, like your company or team name. Enter other details for your organization and click the submit button.

<Warning>
    When a new Organization is created, it is marked as inactive (indicated by a red X). A Gloo admin must manually approve the organization you can access features like data ingestion.

### Step 3: Create a Publisher

Once your organization has been approved, you can set up Publishers. Your organization needs at least one Publisher to ingest data. A Publisher can be an individual content creator or a large book publisher.

Click on your profile icon in the bottom right corner and select **Manage Organizations**. You should see the organization your created listed. Click the **View Publishers** button for that organization then click **Create New Publisher**.

Enter a name for the publisher and any other optional details you want to provide.

Finally, click **Create Publisher**.

### Step 4: Invite a Team Member

You can invite team members to join your organization and perform various tasks.

Click on your profile icon in the bottom right corner and select **Manage Organizations**. You should see the organization your created listed. Click the **Manage Users** button for that organization then click **Invite User**.

Enter the email address of the person you want to invite. Select a role from one of the following options:

- **Admin**: Can manage all aspects of the organization, including setting up publishers, inviting new users and managing data ingestion.
- **Editor**: Can upload content for data ingestion.
- **Viewer**: Can view ingestion analytics and use components.

Finally, click **Send Invitation**.

You're all set!
