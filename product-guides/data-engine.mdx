The Data Engine is the intelligence layer of Gloo AI. It doesn't just store information—it transforms raw data into ministry-ready insights that power search, discovery, and decision support across our ecosystem.

## What It Does

The Data Engine is a sophisticated pipeline that handles every step of the content lifecycle, from initial ingestion to making it available for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
